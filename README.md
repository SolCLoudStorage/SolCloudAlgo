# SolCloudAlgo
This document explores the sophisticated algorithms and complex mathematical calculations at the core of SolCloud's operations. Our focus is on the encryption methods, erasure coding for data redundancy, the reward mechanism for node validators, and optimization techniques for data retrieval.
Encryption Techniques
SolCloud employs a hybrid encryption model, combining the speed of symmetric encryption (AES) with the security of asymmetric encryption (RSA).
